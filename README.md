# JS-Lex #

## What Is It? ##
A [lexer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) generator written in JavaScript that uses the languageâ€™s regular expression engine to perform its analysis.

## Usage ##
For anyone familiar with lex, flex, and friends the syntax is familiar enough. The following will create a lexer that will tokenize a JavaScript-like text. A full example can be found in the repository.

    var rules = [
        [/(?:"((?:\\.|[^"])*)"|'((?:\\.|[^'])*)')/, 'STRING'
        , function (token) {
            token.value = (token.match[1] || token.match[2] || '')
                .replace(/\\(?:u([0-9a-fA-F]{4})|x([0-9a-fA-F]{2})|([0-3][0-7]{0,2}|[0-7]{1,2})|(.))/g, function () {
                  var match = arguments;
                  var c;
                  if (c = match[1] || match[2]) {
                    return String.fromCharCode(parseInt(c, 16));
                  } else if (c = match[3]) {
                    return String.fromCharCode(parseInt(c, 8));
                  } else {
                    c = match[4];
                    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(ESCAPES, c)) {
                      return ESCAPES[c];
                    } else {
                      return c;
                    }
                  }
                });
          }]
      , [/([_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*)\(/, 'FUNC'
        , function (token) {
            token.value = token.match[1];
          }]
      , [/[+-]?(?:(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+|0[0-7]+)|((?:[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]*)?|\.[0-9]+)(?:[eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?|NaN|Infinity))/, 'NUM'
        , function (token) {
            if (token.match[1]) {
              token.value = parseInt(token.match[0]);
            } else {
              token.value = parseFloat(token.match[0]);
            }
          }]
      , [/\)/, 'RPAREN']
      , [/;/, 'SEMI']
      , [/,/, 'COMMA']
      , [/\s+/, null]
      ];

    lexer = new Lexer(rules);

## Notes ##
At the moment, `Lexer` does not support macros (the definitions section for users of lex). There are also no guards on the regular expressions preventing the use of non-regular constructs (e.g. back references) that are exposed by the language; the generated lexer will not work properly of those are used.
